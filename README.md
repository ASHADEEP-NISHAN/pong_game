Pong, an early arcade video game released in 1972 by Atari, simulates table tennis with two players controlling paddles. The objective is to hit a moving ball back and forth, aiming to score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle. The game's minimalist design, played on a simple black-and-white interface, contributed to its widespread popularity and established the foundation for the video game industry. Pong's success marked a pivotal moment in gaming history, showcasing the potential of interactive entertainment and setting the stage for the development of more complex and innovative video games.
